\# Hello CI/CD Project (Python)



This project demonstrates a simple CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and security scanning using GitHub Actions.



\## What’s here

\- Python “Hello World” app (`app.py`)

\- Automated test with `pytest` (`test\_app.py`)

\- Security scan with `bandit`

\- CI/CD workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)



\## How it works

1\. Push code to GitHub.

2\. GitHub Actions installs dependencies.

3\. Runs tests (`pytest`).

4\. Runs a security scan (`bandit -r .`).



\## Why it matters

Shows CI/CD, automation, and integrating security checks — key DevSecOps skills.
